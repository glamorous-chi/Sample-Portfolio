## Acknowledgments

This is my second challenge for the Tech Studio Academy June 2024 Online Internship. This challenge really tested me time-wise. Hoping that whatever challenges we will be given in the future will only help us improve our skills and become more experienced developers.
Thanks to the Internship Team for this challenge.
