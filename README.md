### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS utility classes
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid, CSS Grid properties, and Flexbox. Most importantly, I learned how to use Utility classes and Custom properties to my advantage. I also learnt how to do a reset in order to remove some default styles that came with some HTML elements. For example, HTML Paragraphs come with a default margin of 16px at the top and bottom, and a reset removes such, so I can give my own styles as I wish.

```css
/* Using Grid Template areas to achieve the design layout */
.section-grid{
    grid-template-areas:
    "one one four"
    "two three four"
    "five five five" ;
  }
```

### Continued development

I will love to sharpen my skills when it comes to building a good design structure however the Layout may be i.e following a Mobile-first design approach whilst keeping my Desktop design in mind. Essentially, learning to see the bigger pcture and not focusing just on my Mobile design but seeing how my desktop design layout differs from my Mobile design layout and ensuring that both designs come out well while building.
